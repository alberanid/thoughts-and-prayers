# Thoughts & Prayers

Let's face it: we are all busy and lazy people.  That, and our horrible attention span, conspire against us making us look like monsters in mourning times.

But now we have Thoughts & Prayers!  Thoughts & Prayers will save the world!

Thoughts & Prayers is a [polygen](https://polygen.org/) grammar for busy people, helping them populating their Twitter (or even better, Mastodon!) timeline in time of need (i.e. "always").

This time it will totally work.


## Use

* install **polygen**
* run **polygen tap.grm**
* feel a better person


## Mastodon bot

A demo bot can be found at [@thoughts_and_prayers](https://botsin.space/@thoughts_and_prayers)

You can use the content of the *Dockerfile.mastodon* file to create your own Mastodon bot; don't forget to run it specifying the **TAPBOT_TOKEN** environment variable.
